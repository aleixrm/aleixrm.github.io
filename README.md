## Development

### Live Reload
While the server is running, Hugo injects JavaScript into the generated HTML pages. The LiveReload script creates a connection from the browser to the server via web sockets.

### Running server locally

Execute the following command for running hugo embedded server:
```
hugo server
```

Then you can connect to the server through `http://localhost:1313/`
